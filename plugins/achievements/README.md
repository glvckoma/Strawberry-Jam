# Achievements Plugin

A powerful plugin that unlocks most in-game achievements in Animal Jam Classic with a single command.

## Features

- Unlocks approximately 140+ in-game achievements
- Works with a simple chat command
- Achievements are unlocked sequentially with proper timing
- Achievement unlocks are visible in your profile

## How to Use

1. Join a game session in Animal Jam Classic
2. Type the following command in the console

```
achievements
```

4. Wait while the plugin sequentially unlocks achievements (this process takes a few minutes)
5. Check your profile to see all your newly unlocked achievements


## How It Works

The plugin sends specialized achievement completion packets to the server for each achievement ID in its database. It carefully times these requests (110ms between each) to avoid overwhelming the server or triggering anti-cheat mechanisms.

## Important Notes

- The unlocking process may take a few minutes to complete due to the intentional delays
- Some achievements might still require specific in-game actions to fully unlock
- The plugin will only work if you're properly connected to the game
- Achievement unlocks are permanent on your account

## Compatibility

This plugin is designed for Animal Jam Classic only.
