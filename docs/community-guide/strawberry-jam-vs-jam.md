# Strawberry Jam vs. Jam: What's Different?

---

## üçì For Everyone (Kids/Easy-to-Read)

**Strawberry Jam** is a special, improved version of the original Jam project for Animal Jam Classic. Here's what makes it different and better:

- **New & Improved Tools!**
  - **Login Packet Manipulator:** Lets you change how you log in (not possible in the original Jam).
  - **Username Logger:** Collects and checks usernames for you.
  - **Better "Report a Problem":** If something goes wrong, it's now easier to send helpful information to developers, as the app collects more detailed logs automatically.
  - **Secure Account Saving:** If you choose to save your login details, they are now stored more securely using your computer's built-in secure storage (thanks to Keytar integration).

- **Safety & Privacy**
  - **LeakCheck Integration:** Checks usernames with a special database (you'll need your own API key).
  - **Secure Account Storage:** As mentioned above, your saved accounts are better protected.

- **Cleaner & Faster**
  - **Auto-Clearing Logs:** Console and network logs can be set to clear themselves after a certain number of messages, so things don't get too messy or slow.
  - **Automatic Old Log Cleanup:** The app now automatically cleans up very old log files to save space.

- **Just for Fun**
  - More features and improvements are coming all the time!
